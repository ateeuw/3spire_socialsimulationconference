# 3spire_socialsimulationconference
This repository contains the model I used for the paper published proceeding the Social Simulation Conference 2023, and the analyses I ran on the model output data.  
  
The model: 20230722SSCversion.nlogo  
The analysis: Figures_and_tables.R  

The model uses the data in the Netlogo_Input folder
The analysis is run on data in the Netlogo_Output folder. Be aware that if you run the model with the same parameters (b = 0.45, optimism = 1.05), the original output file used to create the results presented in the paper will be deleted.
